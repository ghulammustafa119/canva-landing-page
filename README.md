# canva-landing-page
My first app — a simple landing page built with HTML and CSS, created using AI-driven development through the Gemini CLI.

This is a **simple landing page** built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Currently, the project contains **two files**:

- `index.html` – The main HTML page  
- `style.css` – The stylesheet for the page

---

## Features

- Clean and minimal design
- Fully functional with just HTML and CSS
- Easy to modify and expand

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ghulammustafa119/canva-landing-page.git

2. Open index.html in your browser to view the landing page.

3 .Edit style.css to change colors, fonts, or layout as needed.

## Notes
---

- This is an initial version for testing and learning purposes.
- More pages and features will be added later.
